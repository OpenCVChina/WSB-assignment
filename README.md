# Assignment for WSB

This repo is for the assignment of the hands-on session of the Winter School on Biometrics (https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/wsb2024/index.php). Before starting, make sure OpenCV is installed. If not, you can install OpenCV-Python using pip: `pip install opencv-python` or `pip install opencv-contrib-python` with extra features.

If you want to run models with TIM-VX backend and NPU target on Khadas VIM3, you will need to compile OpenCV from source with Python Interface following this guide (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TIM-VX-Backend-For-Running-OpenCV-On-NPU).
